Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is often used when a problem can be divided into subproblems that are similar to the original.

Simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
Useful in mathematical computations like compound interest, Fibonacci series, and time series predictions.
Naturally models repetitive calculations, such as calculating the future value of an investment over multiple periods.

Advantages of Optimization:
Reduces repeated calculations.
Improves performance especially when:
Recursive depth is high.
The model includes multiple variables or dependencies.
